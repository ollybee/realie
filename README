Realie - A Realtime Collaborative Code Editor

Aim of this project is to build a pastie/gist sort of an online code sharing utility, with realtime collaboration (similar to Etherpad). I started this project as part of my individual research project in the University.
 You can find my notes related to this project from here - http://www.web2media.net/laktek/tag/realie/

If you like to test out the app you will need to install the following:

1) Node.js - 0.1.96+ (http://nodejs.org)
2) socket.io Server Library (npm install socket.io)

Follow the standard installations of above programs as mentioned in their documentation.

Once you have setup those, 
* Clone this repository - git://github.com/christophlsa/realie.git

* Change the path back to head.

* Change the branch to 'socket.io'

* Copy all files <https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/tree/master/support/socket.io-client>
  to public/javascripts/socket.io

* Then again inside the app's source path run :
  `node app.js`

* Finally, open Browser and visit:
  http://localhost:8888/pad


Contact me via GitHub if you have issues, suggestions or need any help regarding this app.
